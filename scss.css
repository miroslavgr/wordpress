&:hover - parent hover

& stays for parent

%box-shadow{styles}

a
{
  @extends %box-shadow; -- add it like a string variable
}

Variables - same like php but instead of = we use :
their scope are at the level where defined and below, if defined outside of anything they become global
or if nsted can make it !global and use it anywhere, like php.

$width : 5px;

#main 
{
  wdith: $width 
}
